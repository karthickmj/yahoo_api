# yahoo_api
A python library to scrape Yahoo! Finance

This library enables users to independently collect financial data from Yahoo! Finance, thereby eliminating the need for third-party data providers. This allows for greater flexibility and control over the data collection process, saving valuable time and effort.

The library is designed to be as easy as possible to use. Most of the methods of this library are called like Yahoo! Finance's Webpages.
